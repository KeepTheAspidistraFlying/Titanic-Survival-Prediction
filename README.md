# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
Using Machine Learning/ Logistic Regression

Hey Guyz;

so basically the code predicts whether or not someone with specific features survive Titanic or not. The accuracy score is a little more than 80%.

Ive used different packages in this code, such as numpy, pandas and scikitlearn.

Ive also written a few words to cover the basics of ML, if ure interested plz check "Basics of Machine Learning".

if u have any question or suggestion, plz contact me via my email; Hajiahmadiparisa@yahoo.com
